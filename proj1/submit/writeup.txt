Part 3. Writeup
1. The construction of HMAC token is defined as the following:
token = HMAC_userPassword( SHA256( key + SHA256( key + message ) ) )

The idea of making the HMAC guarded against the length extension attack is the 
double hashing part of the token. By this design the key is now no longer vulnerable
to the extension attacked described in the 1.1 of the assignment. 

The reason that a length extension attack work is because H(password) is known
to the attacker. HMAC requires different input to make it work and hence guarded 
against length extension attack.

2.
The technique explored in Section 2.2 poses a danger to systems that rely on digital signatures because using this technique an attacker can introduce extra, malicious code without the knowledge of the program or the user since the hash of the program will still be completely valid.
