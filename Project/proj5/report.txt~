    Evidence_2 shows that system unable to detect any bootable hard disk
    drive. An error message is displayed "FATAL: No bootable medium is 
    found! System halted".
    So in order to access the system, "ESC" was pressed to enter menu. 
    Before doing this, network adaptor is removed (disabled in this case),
    to prevent remote wipe of the disk image.
    The OS is then booted using recovery mode. "root" was choosen from 
    the recovery menu. Now, we have the root shell access.

    19:48:24 UTC 2009 i686 GNU/Linux. Please refer to evidence_3.

    Under the folder "vol4-3.home.nefarious.passwords", there're 5 .txt file, namely
    password1.txt, password2.txt, password3.txt, password4.txt and password5.txt.

6.  Yes. evidence_6 is the memory block of the browsing history for firefox.
    It is pointed to meta by inode number 218148 from /home/nefarious/.mozilla/firefox/

    According to evidence_8, the suspect visited metacafe.com, Facebook,
    popularmechanics.com, digg.com, google.com searching for knowledge regarding Nerf Gun.
    The suspect deleted such browsing history. However, the memory is not reallocated yet.
    Therefore, we are able to use autopsy to retrieve the file under direct block 16154 from
    evidence_6.

7.  The very obvious file that the suspect deleted is the .bash_history and evil_plan.bmp. 
    This is supported by the .bash_history under current session from evidence:
    vol4-3.home.nefarious..bash_history.
    Also, from the vol4-3.var.log.auth.log, we are able to tell that @ Nov 30 12:14:17, the 
    suspect double checked that the fragment of evil_plan.bmp is properly deleted. Therefore,
    there’s no way to recover the evidence at software or system level. However, we are able
    to recover the thumbnail of the evil_plan.bmp. Please refer to
    vol4-3.home.nefarious..thumbnails.normal.22d0c19de013e5009a681dd92e965fbd.png.
    Furthermore, several password text file were removed supported by evidence_7.
    We are unable to recover the .bash_history that was deleted before the arrest.
    A password.ls.part is also removed supported by evidence 
    vol4-3.home.nefarious.Desktop.password.lst.part.
