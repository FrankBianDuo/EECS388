# Part 1: Live Analysis
1.  From evidence_1, anti-theft mechanism is initialized for normal boot.
    Hard disk drive be destroyed by the anti-theft system.
    Evidence_2 shows that system unable to detect any bootable hard disk
    drive. An error message is displayed "FATAL: No bootable medium is 
    found! System halted".
    So in order to access the system, "ESC" was pressed to enter menu. 
    Before doing this, network adaptor is removed (disabled in this case),
    to prevent remote wipe of the disk image.
    The OS is then booted using recovery mode. "root" was choosen from 
    the recovery menu. Now, we have the root shell access.

2.  Linux nefarious-laptop 2.6.28-16-generic #55-Ubuntu SMP Tue Oct 20 
    19:48:24 UTC 2009 i686 GNU/Linux. Please refer to evidence_3.

3.  The computer name is nefarious-laptop and nefarious is used for irc chatroom.
    So, "nefarious" is the most commonly used username for the suspect. 

4.  username:"swolchok" with a nickname "accomplice" based on irclogs.
    Please refer to evidence_4. According to the chat log, swolchok was waiting
    outside the "dough building" (DOW building) at 3:15 AM.

5.  There is a encrypted file named “passwords.zip” found under “/home/nefarious/“.
    By using fcrackzip, password "warrant" is recovered, refer to evidence_5 
    Under the folder "vol4-3.home.nefarious.passwords", there're 5 .txt file, namely
    password1.txt, password2.txt, password3.txt, password4.txt and password5.txt.
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
    password1.txt contains string "mystery".
    password2.txt contains string "love".
    password3.txt contains string "secretpassword".
    password4.txt contains string "MONKEY".
    password5.txt contains string "jjdMn7vM3wU5tA".
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Linux command:
    fcrack -u -D -p american-english /root/Downloads/vol4-3.home.nefarious.passwords.zip
    System used:  Linux kali 3.18.0-kali1-amd64 #1 SMP Debian 3.18.3-1~kali4 (2015-01-22)
                  x86_64 GNU/Linux
    Dictionary attack is recommended to use before brute-force method.
    Hence, a default wordlist in Kali Linux is used.

6.  Yes. evidence_6 is the memory block of the browsing history for firefox.
    It is pointed to meta by inode number 218148 from /home/nefarious/.mozilla/firefox/
    4vda6zgy.default/. There are evidences indicating that user browsed eBay: 
    1. http://shop.ebay.com/?_from=R40&_trksid=p3907.m38.l1313&_nkw=nerf+gun&_sacat=
       See-All-Categories.

    3. http://www.ehow.com/how_4765156_choose-nerf-gun.htmlH
    According to evidence_8, the suspect visited metacafe.com, Facebook,
    popularmechanics.com, digg.com, google.com searching for knowledge regarding Nerf Gun.
    The suspect deleted such browsing history. However, the memory is not reallocated yet.
    Therefore, we are able to use autopsy to retrieve the file under direct block 16154 from
    evidence_6.

7.  The very obvious file that the suspect deleted is the .bash_history and evil_plan.bmp. 
    This is supported by the .bash_history under current session from evidence:
    vol4-3.home.nefarious..bash_history.
    Also, from the vol4-3.var.log.auth.log, we are able to tell that @ Nov 30 12:14:17, the 
    suspect double checked that the fragment of evil_plan.bmp is properly deleted. Therefore,
    there’s no way to recover the evidence at software or system level. However, we are able
    to recover the thumbnail of the evil_plan.bmp. Please refer to
    vol4-3.home.nefarious..thumbnails.normal.22d0c19de013e5009a681dd92e965fbd.png.
    Furthermore, several password text file were removed supported by evidence_7.
    We are unable to recover the .bash_history that was deleted before the arrest.
    A password.ls.part is also removed supported by evidence 
    vol4-3.home.nefarious.Desktop.password.lst.part.

9.  1. We examine the entire hard disk drive. We found that there is another partition.
    2. Under the /root/ folder there is two script namely, get_external_ip.sh and
    tweet_alarm.sh. After examine the script, the suspect twitted two messages on 
    twitter with two distinct ip addresses: 141.212.54.121 and 68.40.49.30.
    3. under /home/nefarious/.ssh/known_hosts, we found that the suspect
    sshed two server @ fanfare.eecs.umich.edu, 141.212.109.58 and 141.212.111.42.
    We emailed HQ and requested for further investigations to those two ip addresses.
    Notified by HQ, the server changed ip address to 54.166.91.77. 
    4. The suspect downloaded the Metasploit framework 3.3 on his Desktop.

10. We are able to browse the default page on the server. The following messages 
    are displayed:
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Academic Researcher
    Dr. Academic Researcher is a loser who knows nothing about computer security.
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Therefore, our best guess would be that the site was previously owned by
    Dr. Academic Research. Since, both ftp and ssh are available, we decide to use
    ssh to login into the machine. 
    However, the username is missing at the current stage. Username such as
    nefarious didn’t work. We decide to go back to auth.log
    supported in evidence: vol4-3.var.log.auth.log. During the period of attack, 
    nefarious was in the sudo mode. This is backed the evidence in the log:
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Nov 24 23:09:57 nefarious-laptop sudo: nefarious : TTY=pts/0 ; 
    PWD=/home/nefarious/hydra-5.4-src ; 
    USER=root ; 
    COMMAND=/sbin/ifconfig eth0 141.212.111.41
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Therefore, it’s reasonable to believe that the username used could be root.
    As for the password, we managed to find 5 text files that were encrypted.
    After several attempts, the following credentials are useful:
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
    username: root
    password: jjdMn7vM3wU5tA
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    Supported by evidence_11.png, the sole owner to the machine appears to be 
    Dr. Academic Researcher who uses "academic" as the username on the machine.

11.  We did a port scan on the server using nmap on Kali Linux.
     We found that there are ports opened on the server, supported by evidence_10.\
     The services that are opened on server are:
     -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
     PORT        STATE   SERVICE
     21/tcp      open    ftp
     22/tcp      open    ssh
     80/tcp      open    http
     554/tcp     open    rtsp
     7070/tcp    open    realserver
     -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
     However, the type of OS running on the server is unknown from the first scan.
     Since the computer has a domain name ec2-54-166-91-77.compute-1.amazonaws.com,
     our best guess is that the server is a virtual machine on amazon cloud. 
     RTSP and realserver are streaming services. The main purpose of the machine 
     appears to be a server providing web, file, streaming services. Apache2 is
     running on the machine providing web service.

12.  From the auth.log on suspect's machine and the auth.log on Dr. Academic's 
     machine, there're more than dozens of failed remote login attempts. This 
     clearly that the access to the machine was not granted to the suspect. 
     In this case, it's likely that the suspect did a dictionary attack on Dr.
     Academic's machine. The machine is compromized as according to the wtmp file
     on the debian machine. Referring to evidence_12.png, we can see the suspect
     ip address of 141.212.111.41 was logged on into machine on
     ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
     root   pts/0   141.212.111.41  Wed Nov 25 10:31 - 10:36 
     -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Also, he intentionally changed his ip address to 141.212.111.41 and the remote
     server ip address to 141.212.111.41 so that both stations are in the same 
     subnet. 


13.  Supported by evidence_8.png, the suspect clearly logged on into the machine 
     he first changed the ip address of the server to 141.212.111.42. He removed
     .bash_history without authorization. furthermore, he changed the default 
     web page hosted on the machine to insult Dr. Academic Researher.
     Also we discovered an ambiguous comment:"The duck flies at midnight!" in the
     body of the page. This phrase is actually commented out.
     The suspect also change the root password. Then he shut down the server.
     This is supported in the same evidence_8.png.
