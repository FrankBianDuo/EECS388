# Project 3 Part 1

1.  00:26:08:e5:66:07 10.0.2.1 (default gateway)
    04:0c:ce:d8:0f:fa 10.0.2.2
    8c:a9:82:50:f0:a6 10.0.2.3

2.  By doing a address resolution under "Statistic", we found that there are traffics going to lb.wordpress.com, ctools.umich.edu, yf1.yahoo.com, guardian.co.uk, facebook.com and etc. Therefore, an educated guess is that this is a LAN with a local network address 10.0.2.0/24.

3a. At time 83.602865 host with ip address 10.0.2.2 initiated an ftp connection to 194.109.21.66 which is mapped to dl.xs4all.nl. 

3b. The connection is most likely to be an active FTP. At time 83.602865, the client initiated an connection with an unprivileged source port: 50952 to destination port 21. Server syn + ack to the clients ftp command port at time 83.711403.Since throughout the ftp connection, only one unprivileged port, 50952, is opened and used, the ftp connection is active FTP.

3c. By using filter: tcp.port == 443 && ip.src == 10.0.2.0/24, we can easily get all local hosts who initiate outbound ftp connection. The FTP login credential is in plain text. Although no successful login - 530 response -, but user information such as USER := laticia.langhans at time 115.175217 and Pass:= goblue3859 at time 121.727321 is captured in plain text. This is vulnerable to attacker.

3d. SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol) OR FTPS (FTP over SSL/TLS) 

4a. By using filter: tcp.port == 443 && ip.src == 10.0.2.0/24, we can get all local hosts who initiate outbound https connection.
